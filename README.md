    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/onlinejudge
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

### Running the Server

1. **Start MongoDB**:
    Make sure MongoDB is running. If you have MongoDB installed locally, you can start it with:
    ```sh
    mongod
    ```
